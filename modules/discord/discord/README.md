# Where's all the files?

For legal reasons, Discord libraries and raw source code files cannot be redistributed by non-Discord staff.

If you want to build this module for yourself, grab the Discord Game SDK [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/sdk-starter-guide), and slap all of the header and source files into this directory.
